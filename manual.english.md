# General use

After a (re)boot of your Mac, depending on the setup Apache and MySQL are already running.
In my personal setup I have to start these manually. I open a terminal and start the services:

```
$ startdevelopment
```

Apache, MariaDB, DNSMasq and Mailhog are now ready for use.

# Create a new database

- Create a new database with Sequel Pro

# Create a new website

Creating a new website is very simple. In the Sites folder create a new subfolder for your website.

As an example create a folder **testwebsite**.

```
$ mkdir ~/Development/Sites/testwebsite
```

Then add your html/php/whatever files in the folder ~/Development/Sites/testwebsite.

There is nothing else to configure. The website is immediately ready in your browser at http://testwebsite.test

# Stop Development

Apache, MariaDB, DNSMasq and Mailhog can be stopped with the terminal command:

```
$ stopdevelopment
```

# Restart development

Apache, MariaDB, DNSMasq and Mailhog can be restarted with the terminal command:

```
$ restartdevelopment
```

# Reference
